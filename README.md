# NSUI Banner Fixer

This fixes GBA VC banners created with [New Super Ultimate Injector v28](https://gbatemp.net/threads/discussion-new-super-ultimate-injector-nsui.500376/post-9174080) not showing the VC text box for non-US consoles.

WARNING: Overwriting an injected GBA game will overwrite its save file.
Consider backing up your saves before, e.g. with [GBAVCSM](https://github.com/TurdPooCharger/GBAVCSM).

# Usage

Either run the included `nsui_banner_fixer.exe` through the command line:

`nsui_banner_fixer.exe example.cia`

or copy all the .cia files you want to fix next to the executable and run the program by double clicking.

Either  way your fixed .cia files will be created in the `out` directory.

Use the `-v` argument to see more info during the process.
